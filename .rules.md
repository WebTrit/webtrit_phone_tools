# LLM Context & Routing Guide

This project uses a modular rules system. To provide accurate code, you MUST follow these steps:

**STEP 1: ALWAYS READ GLOBAL RULES**
You must strictly adhere to the formatting, import ordering, and linting rules defined in: `.rules/global.rules.md`

**STEP 2: READ DOMAIN-SPECIFIC RULES**
Depending on the task requested by the user, proactively use the `/read` command (or your file-reading tool) to load the necessary architectural context:

* Working on CLI Commands, Command parsing, or argument handling? -> Read `.rules/commands.rules.md`
* Working on Architecture, Orchestrator pattern, Processors, Runners, or Services? -> Read `.rules/architecture.rules.md`
